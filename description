   <h2>Description</h2>
  
  <p>The puffins are stocky, short-winged and short-tailed birds, with black upper parts and white or brownish-grey underparts. The head has a black cap, the face is mainly white, and the feet are orange-red. The bill appears large and colourful during the breeding season. The colourful outer part of the bill is shed after the breeding season, revealing a smaller and duller true bill beneath.</p>

  <p>Although the puffins are vocal at their breeding colonies, they are silent at sea. They fly relatively high above the water, typically 10 <abbr aria-label="metres">m</abbr> (33 <abbr aria-label="feet">ft</abbr>) as compared with the 1.6 <abbr aria-label="metres">m</abbr> 5.2 <abbr aria-label="feet">ft</abbr>) of other auks.<p>
